[View the live project here.]()

Bring Us Together is a open network where users can create support and contribute to fully inclusive events. Not only by donating to causes which are close to home but also providing a platform to volunteer time and effort to bring about the social change users feel strongly about.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        The colour scheme of the site is a mix of rainbow colours which signify diversity while encouraging togetherness. A strong symbol of the LGBTQ+ community;
                
        - #A64E77 
        - #033EBC
        - #F2E205
        - #BF5B04
        - #D91604

    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
